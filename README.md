Diversity from a White Dude's Perspective

I have a confession to make.  I am on the planning committee for this
year's Scipy (Birds of a Feather), and there was a lot of initial
discussion about diversity.  I will admit here that I initially rolled
my eyes at this.

Why, I thought, do we have to *talk* about diversity?  I want to talk
about earthquakes, loss modeling, and this weird module level variable
behavior that I discovered a few weeks ago. I don't want to talk about
diversity.

But as I thought about previous attendance at Scipy, and as I look
around the room today, I realize that we *have* to talk about
diversity.  This conference is far more diverse than it used to be -
my first Scipy was in 2007, and I can tell you that there very few
women and people of color at that meeting.  And even today, if you
turn to your left or right, and look at the person next to you, the
odds are still very high that that person looks something like me.

For other possible eye-rollers in the audience, I will try to address
some potential questions.

1) Can we really solve diversity this week, at this conference?

The simple answer is no, we can't.  There are numerous problems that
exist upstream of us, so to speak, including unequal funding in
schools (at all levels), race/gender/sexual orientation bias in hiring,
and the fact that girls are still sometimes told that they're bad at
math.

The more nuanced answer is that we can (and should!) do *something*.
"If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem."

What can we do?  I don't know all the things we can do, but we can at
least:

  a) Be encouraging and friendly to those people already at the
     conference who look different from us.

  b) Be encouraging and friendly to those people back in our regular
     lives who look different from us, but aspire to work in science, or
     computing, or at the intersection between them.

  c) Scholarships?  Reaching out to schools in under-served communities?
     I don't know, but I know there are people here who have great ideas
     and want to talk about them.

2) Why do you care?  Do you have a dog in this fight?

In some immediate sense, no I don't have a dog in this fight.  But I
*do* care, because I want to live in a society where everyone can
contribute to science, regardless of what they look like, how they
talk, or what they do in their personal time.  And if that isn't
enough of an argument, how about this: I've met a lot of other middle-aged
white dudes like myself at this conference over the years.  Don't get
me wrong - you guys are great - we've had some fascinating
conversations, but maybe, just maybe, it gets a little boring talking
to people who look like me all the time.  So there's that.

So do you *have* to talk about diversity?  No, you don't.  You don't
even *have* to think it about it if you don't want to.  But don't roll
your eyes at it, because it *is* important, and we *can* help solve the
problem.

If you *do* want to talk about it, then there is a Diversity and
Inclusion BOF on Friday where a whole bunch of people who are already
talking about these issues would welcome your input.  I encourage you
to attend, if you are so inclined.

As for me, regardless of what you look like, sound like, or how you
spend your personal time, I would *love* to talk to you about
earthquakes, loss models, or that weird module variable behavior I
discovered.
